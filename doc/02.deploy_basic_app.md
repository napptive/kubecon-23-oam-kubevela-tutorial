# Deploying a basic OAM application

Before deploying the app, let's create a new environment/namespace called `kubecon` for the tests.

```bash
vela env init kubecon --namespace kubecon
```
```bash
environment kubecon with namespace kubecon created
```

Next, deploy a basic nginx application with:

```bash
vela up -f scenarios/01.basic_app/nginx-app.yml
```
```bash
Applying an application in vela K8s object format...
I0410 18:35:46.570023    2935 apply.go:121] "creating object" name="nginx-app" resource="core.oam.dev/v1beta1, Kind=Application"
âœ… App has been deployed ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
    Port forward: vela port-forward nginx-app -n kubecon
             SSH: vela exec nginx-app -n kubecon
         Logging: vela logs nginx-app -n kubecon
      App status: vela status nginx-app -n kubecon
        Endpoint: vela status nginx-app -n kubecon --endpoint
```

To access the application use:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:80
```

If the cluster has been installed with `velad` instead of `kind` you can access the app with:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8090/
```

If that port is not accessible, check the port redirections as they may change depending on the elements deployed on your local machine.
```bash
$ docker ps | grep proxy
20f47c1c7297   ghcr.io/k3d-io/k3d-proxy:5.4.6    "/bin/sh -c nginx-prâ€¦"   2 hours ago      Up 2 hours      0.0.0.0:6443->6443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8090->80/tcp                          k3d-velad-cluster-default-serverlb
```

## Alternative with kubectl

OAM applications can be deployed using the standard Kubernetes API as any other CRD. To do that, use:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-kubevela create -f scenarios/01.basic_app/nginx-app.yml
```
```bash
application.core.oam.dev/nginx-app created
```

For installations with `velad` make sure you have exported the kubeconfig file as defined in the previous step if your are not able to connect to Kubernetes.

Next, check the status of the application with:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-kubevela get app
```
```bash
NAME        COMPONENT   TYPE         PHASE     HEALTHY   STATUS      AGE
nginx-app   nginx       webservice   running   true      Ready:1/1   8s
```

## Cleanup

To delete an application with the vela cli use:

```bash
vela delete nginx-app
```
```bash
Are you sure to delete the application kubecon/nginx-app (y/n)y
Start deleting appplication kubecon/nginx-app
Delete appplication kubecon/nginx-app succeeded
```

As an alternative, you may use kubectl directly with:

```bash
$ kubectl --context kind-kubevela delete app nginx-app
```
```bash
application.core.oam.dev "nginx-app" deleted
```
