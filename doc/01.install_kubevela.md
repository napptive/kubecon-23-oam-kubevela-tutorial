# Installing a basic KubeVela development environment

In this step, we will explore different methods to create a basic KubeVela local environment. The recommended path relies on Kind, while it is also possible to install it with [VelaD](#alternatively-with-velad). Alternatively, you may also try [Napptive](http://try.napptive.com/playground?campaign_source=kubecon23) to deploy simple OAM applications.

To start, let's create a kind cluster named *kubevela*.

```bash
kind create cluster --config=installation/basic_cluster/kind_basic_cluster_config.yaml --name=kubevela
kubectl --context kind-kubevela wait --for=condition=Ready nodes --all --timeout=600s
```

Next, install KubeVela using the official Helm chart.

```bash
helm repo add kubevela https://charts.kubevela.net/core
helm repo update
helm install --create-namespace -n vela-system kubevela kubevela/vela-core --wait
```

Once KubeVela has been installed, install an ingress controller for the tests.

```bash
kubectl --context kind-kubevela apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl --context kind-kubevela wait --namespace ingress-nginx \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=90s
```

Once everything is installed, we will check the state of the installation with:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-kubevela get nodes
kubectl --context kind-kubevela -n vela-system get pods
```

Finally, let's install the Vela CLI tool. Notice that the tool may require root permissions to copy the binary. For other installation methods, check the [official documentation](https://kubevela.io/docs/installation/kubernetes#install-vela-cli).

```bash
curl -fsSl https://kubevela.net/script/install.sh | bash
```

Once the CLI is available, you should be able to perform OAM related operations such as obtaining the list of available component definitions.

```bash
vela comp
```

Once you no longer require the development cluster, you can delete it with:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name=kubevela
```

## Alternatively with VelaD

[VelaD](https://github.com/kubevela/velad) is a lightweight tool to deploy KubeVela and that relies on [K3s](https://k3s.io/). The tool is in active development and the resulting cluster may be used for the initial part of the tutorial. It is not recommended for the multi-cluster deployment section as it will require reconfiguring the networking.

To install the tool, use the following command. Notice that it may ask for root priviledges to install the binary. Check the [official documentation](https://kubevela.io/docs/installation/standalone#2-install-velad-and-setup-kubevela) for more information.

```bash
curl -fsSl https://static.kubevela.net/script/install-velad.sh | bash
```

Once VelaD is installed, you can create a cluster with:

```bash
velad install
```

To access the cluster, export the kubeconfig with:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(velad kubeconfig --host)
```

After that, you will be able to check the installation as in the alternative Kind approach with the following commands. If the `vela` CLI is not available refer to the alternate steps to install it.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
vela comp
```
Once the cluster is no longer required, you can delete it with:

```bash
velad uninstall
```
