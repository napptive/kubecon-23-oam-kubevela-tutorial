# Application workflows

Workflows enable us to define the orchestration of the application deployment. To do that, an application may be associated with a [Workflow](https://kubevela.io/docs/end-user/workflow/overview) in which we make use of the available [WorkflowStepDefinitions](https://kubevela.io/docs/end-user/workflow/built-in-workflow-defs) to define the individual steps.

To illustrate how workflows can be used, lets take the WordPress example and define a workflow that will perform the following steps:

1. Deploy a test service that simulates a discovery subsystem. This will be use later on to demonstrate how the workflow can communicate with other subsystems.
2. Deploy mysql
3. Deploy wordpress
4. Send a registration message to an HTTP endpoint
5. Add information to the application status

To execute the example, use:

```bash
vela up -f scenarios/complex_app/wordpress_with_workflow.yml
```

Checking the status will show the state of the workflow and its progress

```bash
$ vela status my-wordpress-wf -n kubecon
